# Plasma Solver

Currently, this project is attempting to solve the following problems using the kinetic Monte Carlo approach.

* `2reaction` (problem specified here: http://www.zdplaskin.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/index.html@p=292.html) 
* `MicroCathode` (problem specified here: http://www.zdplaskin.laplace.univ-tlse.fr/index.html@p=310.html)
* `Brusselator` (problem specified here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brusselator)

Files related specifically to any of these projects are in the corresponding project folder.

If you seek a user manual for the solver, it is included in the thesis ``Stochastic approach to plasma kinetics``.
